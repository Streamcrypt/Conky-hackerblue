# Installation of Conky

```bash
sudo apt update        # or update according to your Linux distro
sudo apt install conky # or install using your distro's package manager
````

# Procedures to Setup

1. Clone the repository to your machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Streamcrypt/Conky-hackerblue.git
   ```
2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Conky-hackerblue
   ```
3. If you don't have Conky installed, install it (see Installation section above).
4. Start Conky with the included script:

   ```bash
   bash start_conky.sh
   ```
5. Check your desktop. If Conky does not appear correctly:

   * Open your file manager, find `wallpaper.png` in the project folder,
   * Right-click it and set it as your desktop wallpaper.

Now your desktop should match the setup shown in this project.

# Persistent Desktop Conky

If you want Conky to start automatically every time you boot:

1. Open your system's **Startup Applications** (or **Session and Startup**) settings.
2. Click **Add** (or **Application Autostart** ‚Üí **Add**).
3. Give it a name and (optionally) a description.
4. For the command, browse to and select the `start_conky.sh` script inside your cloned `Conky-hackerblue` folder (or enter the full path), e.g.:

   ```
   /home/your-username/Conky-hackerblue/start_conky.sh
   ```
5. Make sure the entry is enabled (run on login), save, and reboot. Conky should start automatically on boot.
